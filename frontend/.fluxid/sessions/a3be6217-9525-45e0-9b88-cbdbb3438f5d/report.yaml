summary: "Systematically fixed pre-commit hook issues. Out of 41 hooks, 40 are now passing. Only the pytest coverage hook remains failing due to a backend module import configuration issue that requires deeper investigation."
next_steps:
  - "Fix pytest configuration to properly recognize backend modules"
  - "Run pytest locally to debug the import error"
  - "Consider adding __init__.py to backend directory or adjusting PYTHONPATH"
