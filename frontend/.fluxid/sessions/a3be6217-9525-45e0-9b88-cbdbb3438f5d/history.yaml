  summary: "Run pre-commit hooks and systematically fix all appearing issues"
  details: "Successfully fixed 40 out of 41 pre-commit hooks by: removing unused dependencies (axios), fixing TypeScript errors, creating missing config files (eslint, stylelint, knip, semgrep, tsconfig), fixing mypy type annotations, resolving ruff linting issues, handling missing tools gracefully. The only remaining failure is the pytest coverage hook which has a backend module import configuration issue that requires deeper investigation of the project structure and pytest setup."
