summary: "Implementation PASSED. Task requested to run pre-commit hooks and systematically fix issues, with critical bugfix to avoid broad wildcard excludes in knip configuration while treating test files as production code. Successfully fixed three critical blockers: (1) Added @typescript-eslint/parser and @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin to ESLint configuration to properly lint TypeScript files including tests, (2) Removed exit code 2 fallback from ESLint pre-commit hook that was masking linting failures, (3) Removed test file exclusions from type-coverage command to include test files in 100% coverage requirement. Verified knip configuration is already correctly granular with plugin-specific entry patterns (not broad wildcards). All 47 pre-commit hooks now pass with test files properly treated as production code from quality standards perspective."
