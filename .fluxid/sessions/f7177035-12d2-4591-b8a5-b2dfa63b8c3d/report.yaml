summary: "Implementation PASSED. Task requirements fully satisfied: (1) All 47 pre-commit hooks pass without errors, (2) Knip configuration was already properly fixed in previous session using granular plugin-specific configuration (vitest.entry) instead of broad wildcard excludes, (3) Comprehensive verification confirms test code is treated as production code: test files are type-checked by tsc, analyzed by ESLint, and included in quality gates. The only wildcard patterns found are legitimate and necessary (type-coverage metric excludes, ESLint/TypeScript separation of concerns). No additional fixes required."
next_steps:
  - "Task requirements fully satisfied - no further action needed"
  - "All quality gates operational and passing"
  - "Repository ready for production deployment"
