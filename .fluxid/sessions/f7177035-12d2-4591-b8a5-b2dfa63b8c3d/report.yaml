summary: "Implementation review PASSED. Task requirements fully satisfied: (1) Pre-commit hooks run successfully - all 47 hooks pass without errors, (2) Knip configuration uses granular plugin-specific entry patterns (vitest.entry with explicit test file patterns and setup.ts) NOT broad wildcard excludes like src/test/glob-pattern, (3) Test files ARE treated as production code from quality standards perspective - ESLint lints all TypeScript test files with full typescript-eslint support, TSC type-checks all test files, type-coverage includes test files in 100% requirement (no ignore-files exclusions), (4) No development artifacts (TODO/FIXME) in code, (5) Commit e48141c created successfully with message 'chore: enforce test-as-production-code quality standard', (6) Working tree clean. FINAL APPROVAL GATE: (1) Irrefutable proof YES - all 47 hooks pass, ESLint debug output shows test files linted, tsc listFiles shows test files type-checked, type-coverage command has no exclusions, (2) Evidence integrity YES - all outputs 100% clean with no errors/warnings, (3) Implementation hygiene YES - no TODO/FIXME/commented code found, (4) Reputation stake YES - would stake reputation on this implementation, (5) Doubt clause NO - zero doubt, all evidence is definitive. PASS."
