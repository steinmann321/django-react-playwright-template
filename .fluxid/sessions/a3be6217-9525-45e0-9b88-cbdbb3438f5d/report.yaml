    - message: "All 47 pre-commit hooks pass successfully. The knip configuration fix is working correctly."
      location: "frontend/knip.json"
      suggestion: "The granular plugin-specific configuration (vitest.entry) is the correct approach per knip best practices"
      reference: "https://knip.dev/reference/plugins/vitest"
    - message: "Knip without --strict flag shows unused devDependencies (eslint, prettier, stylelint, etc.), but this is expected behavior. The pre-commit hook runs with --strict flag which correctly ignores devDependencies."
      location: ".pre-commit-config.yaml:frontend-knip"
      suggestion: "The --strict flag is appropriate for the pre-commit context as it focuses on production dependencies only"

summary: "Implementation PASSED. Task completed successfully. All 47 pre-commit hooks pass. The critical knip configuration bug has been properly fixed with granular plugin-specific configuration instead of broad wildcard excludes. The setup.ts file is now correctly recognized via vitest.entry configuration. Test code is properly analyzed by quality tools as required. The pre-commit hook uses --strict flag which correctly focuses on production dependencies."
next_steps:
  - "Configuration is production-ready and follows knip best practices"
  - "All quality gates operational and passing"
  - "Task requirements fully satisfied"
