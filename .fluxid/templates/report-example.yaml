status: FAIL

issues:
  blockers:
    - message: "Screenshot not generated - Test failed before screenshot step, check logs for assertion failures"
      location: "tests/home.png"
      code: "SCREENSHOT-001"

  defects:
    - message: "Title assertion failed: expected /app-name/i, received 'Default Title'"
      location: "tests/home.spec.ts:6"
      code: "ASSERT-001"
      suggestion: "Update index.html title or adjust test expectation"

  concerns:
    - message: "No explicit page load wait before assertions"
      location: "tests/home.spec.ts:4"
      code: "TIMING-002"
      suggestion: "Add await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle')"

  observations:
    - message: "Frontend started successfully on port 5173"

  enhancements:
    - message: "Test name could be more descriptive"
      suggestion: "Change 'app loads' to 'home page displays correct title'"

next_steps:
  - "Update index.html title to match expected pattern"
  - "Re-run test to verify assertion passes"
  - "Verify screenshot generation after successful test"

summary: "E2E test failed (attempt #3). Screenshot not generated due to title assertion failure at line 6. Root cause: index.html has default title instead of app-specific title."
